           Problem Statement
           -----------------
The coin and scale puzzle, often referred to as the "Counterfeit Coin Problem,"
is a classic problem-solving challenge where you have a set of identical-looking
coins among which there is one counterfeit coin. The counterfeit coin has a
different weight (either lighter or heavier) than the genuine coins, and you
have a balance scale to help determine which coin is counterfeit using the
minimum number of weighings.
