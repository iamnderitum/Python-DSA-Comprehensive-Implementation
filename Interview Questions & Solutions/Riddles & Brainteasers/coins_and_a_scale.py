            Coins and a Scale
           ------------------

           Problem Statement
           -----------------
You have 8 coins and a two-pan scale. All the coins weigh the same, EXCEPT FOR ONE
which is heavier than all the others. the coins are otherwise indistunguishable. You
may make no assumptions about how much heavier the heavy coin is. 

What is the minimum number of weighings needed to be certain of identifying the coin?
